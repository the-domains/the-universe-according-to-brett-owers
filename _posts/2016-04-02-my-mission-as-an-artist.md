# My Mission as an Artist

There are a few things that I am certain of. 

My soul is about 13.8 billion years old. As a numerologist who believes that consciousness is the seat of creation, the way I interpret this age is that I am the creative (1) force (3) that "leads" or points (.) to the "eternal", or infinity (8). One message I am relaying is that the orientation of the Universe we use is off. The plane of existence we occupy, as well as the aliens of Earth in our galaxy, are adjacent to us. Our Sun is not moving towards them, the path of our Sun is moving parallel with them. We have space dust in the way, blocking our interaction. Those farthest from us, within our own galaxy, are moving parallel to us, but in the opposite direction. As we are moving around the supermassive black hole (or whatever you'd like to call it) at the center of our galaxy, we are moving parallel but in the opposite direction. Even as we turn, the turn, but the space dust still blocks them from our line of view. Now if only it could be that simple, right? 

We are on course for collision with Andromeda. Of all the impending threats to our safety, this one poses an existential threat not only to life on Earth, but life in the Milky Way. All of those within our galaxy must hear the message, and unite for the coming encounter. Even if humanity were to wipe itself out, we would get reruns, just as it has been for all of eternity thus far. But this collision poses the one true threat that it is my sole and soul's responsibility to broadcast to the Universe. FEAR NOT. We will overcome what lies within Andromeda. 

Are they friendly? Some. Are they evil? This term is relative, but compared to our standards, yes, some may be down right evil. Not all of them are evil, but many will fear us. They will have a leader who unites them, much like me, (or you, or we, or whoever you'd like to identify as the reason the Milky Way galaxy becomes united under one governing body), and they will not have as forgiving as our leader. We must exercise restraint when the encounter begins, and minimize the death toll on both sides. I am not so sure that they will do the same. There will be those among them that fear us, that love us, that hate us, and that want to join us, just as we will have those within our galaxy plotting on our downfall. We must unite for this cause. Even if not posing as immediate of a threat as we'd like to imagine, when it's here, there's no telling what exactly will happen. Prepare yourselves, Andromeda is coming, and so are we.
