description: "If you're looking for raven symbolism pertaining to ill omen, death or other gruesome turns of thought, look elsewhere. There are plenty sources to feed macabre minds, and malign the raven. It's not that I'm a big advocate of raven energy, and even if I were, it wouldn't matter because the raven needs no champion."
